Diabetes Classification: KNN vs Logistic Regression
Dataset: This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains medical data used to predict whether a person has diabetes based on the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: Insulin concentration (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body Mass Index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that provides a history of diabetes in the family
Age: Age of the patient
Outcome: 1 if the patient has diabetes, 0 if not

[Objective]
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of two machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression, for classifying whether a person has diabetes or not.
